# LIRI-Bot

This is a simple Command Line Interface (CLI) app that uses NodeJS and the NPM Inquirer Package to provide the user with four different options:
* Use the Spotify API to look up song information. (spotify-this-song)
* Use the Bands in Town API to look up concert information. (concert-this)
* Use the OMDB API to look up movie information. (movie-this)
* Read the file random.txt and display a list of different options for the user to choose from.

## Motivation

I wanted to create a CLI application that could allow for a user to get very specific information quickly and easily, and to do so in a way that would closer emulate server-side environments.
